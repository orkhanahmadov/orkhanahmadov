### Hi there 👋

My name is Orkhan, currently living in Munich, Germany. I'm an experienced software engineer with passion for open-source, currently working at AirLST GmbH as tech team lead.

You can ask me anything about PHP, Laravel, JavaScript and Vue or even better lets collaborate on a project based on these technologies.

From time to time I post about technical articles that I find interesting and useful on my personal blog [orkhan.dev](https://orkhan.dev) 📃, and also publish open-source PHP libraries/packages, like, [Laravel ZIP file content validator](https://github.com/orkhanahmadov/laravel-zip-validator), [Eloquent Repository for Laravel](https://github.com/orkhanahmadov/eloquent-repository), [Yandex Checkout](https://github.com/orkhanahmadov/yandex-checkout), [GoldenPay PHP library](https://github.com/orkhanahmadov/goldenpay), [Laravel Spreadsheet Translations](https://github.com/orkhanahmadov/spreadsheet-translations) etc. If you like my open-source work and want to support me financially, you can sponsor me on [GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/orkhanahmadov) 💖.

Outside of coding mostly I spend time with my wife and little son. I'm also runner 🏃, swimmer 🏊‍♂️ and weightlifter 🏋️‍♂️. If you like running and maybe want some competition, add me on "Nike Run Club": orkhan@fastmail.com

I'm active on Twitter, so you can always reach me there [@orkhanahmadov](https://twitter.com/orkhanahmadov) or you can send me an email: [orkhan@fastmail.com](mailto:orkhan@fastmail.com)

I speak 🇺🇸 English, 🇩🇪 Deutsch, 🇷🇺 Русский, 🇹🇷 Türkçe, 🇦🇿 Azərbaycanca.
