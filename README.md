### Hi there üëã

My name is Orkhan, originally from Baku, Azerbaijan, currently living in Munich, Germany. I'm an experienced web developer with passion for open-source, currently working at AirLST GmbH as senior software engineer.

You can ask me anything about PHP, Laravel, Symfony, JavaScript and Vue or even better lets collaborate on a project based on these technologies.

From time to time I post about technical articles that I find interesting and useful on my personal blog [orkhan.dev](https://orkhan.dev) :page_with_curl:, and also publish open-source PHP libraries/packages, like, [Laravel ZIP file content validator](https://github.com/orkhanahmadov/laravel-zip-validator), [Eloquent Repository for Laravel](https://github.com/orkhanahmadov/eloquent-repository), [SIPGate PHP library](https://github.com/orkhanahmadov/sipgate), [GoldenPay PHP library](https://github.com/orkhanahmadov/goldenpay), etc. If you like my open-source work and want to support me financially, you can sponsor me on [GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/orkhanahmadov) :sparkling_heart:.

Outside of coding mostly I spend time with my wife and little son. I'm also a runner :runner:, if you also like running and maybe want some competition, add me on "Nike Run Club": orkhan@fastmail.com

I'm active on Twitter, so you can always reach me there [@orkhanahmadov](https://twitter.com/orkhanahmadov) or you can send me an email: [orkhan@fastmail.com](mailto:orkhan@fastmail.com)

I speak :us: English, :ru: –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π, :tr: T√ºrk√ße, :azerbaijan: Az…ôrbaycanca and currently learning :de: Deutsch.
